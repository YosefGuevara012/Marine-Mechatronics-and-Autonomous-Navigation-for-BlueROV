# Marine Mechatronics and Autonomous Navigation for BlueROV

This repository provides detailed documentation and implementation guidelines for various aspects of marine mechatronics and autonomous navigation techniques using a BlueROV. It encompasses the implementation of heading and depth control, visual servoing, and sonar-assisted autonomous navigation.

## Heading and Depth Control

**Authors:** Ayesha ASLAM, Worachit KETRUNGSRI, Yosef GUEVARA  
**Date:** March 31, 2023

The practical work includes:
- Establishing the PWM vs thrust relation of the T200 thrusters.
- Validating the PWM vs thrust function experimentally.
- Estimating floatability and implementing proportional controllers for yaw and depth.
- Developing a trajectory compatible with the BlueROV's dynamics and implementing proportional integral controllers (PI) for the yaw and depth.
